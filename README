ORBITER WEB MFD by Salomon BRYS

Provides an embeded web server that permits to handle MFDs on any MODERN browser.
The browser must be able to handle:
 * WebSockets (if using the WebSockets interface)
 * Motion-PNG or Motion-JPEG

Known working browsers :
 - Webkit based browsers like Google Chrome and Apple Safari (Uses PNG, better display - Recommanded)
 - Gecko based browsers like Mozilla Firefox (Uses JPEG Worse display)
The beta version of those browsers are required to use the WebSocket interface.

It also permits any application to display MFDs over network using a very simple protocol.
