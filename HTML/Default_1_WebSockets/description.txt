The Default MFD Web Interface using the WebSockets for the buttons, making them very reactive.<br />
This feature is <b>experimental</b> in all web browsers. If the buttons are disabled and dotted, after 15 seconds, power off the MFD and restart one.<br />
This interface is currently known to be working on Google Chrome <i>beta</i> and Apple Safari <i>beta</i> (including <i>beta</i> IPad version) for a better quality display (based on PNG).<br />
It also works on Mozilla Firefox <i>beta</i> for a lesser quality display (based on JPEG).<br />
Because WebMFD relies on motion pictures, it cannot work on Internet Explorer nor Opera (as they do not implement this standard).
